Add WooCommerce product options, product add-ons and custom product fields before add to cart.

== Description ==

Add-Ons lets store owners offer WooCommerce product options, product add-ons and custom product fields that customers pick before adding a product to the cart: gift wrapping, an engraving message, an extended warranty or a colour choice.

For each product you define a list of add-ons in the WooCommerce product editor. Every add-on has a label, a field type, an optional required flag, and an optional price.

* **Field types**, plain text, a checkbox, or a select drop-down.
* **Text limits**, set minimum and maximum character lengths for text product options.
* **Price deltas**, give an add-on (or each select option) a price; the amount is added to the cart line total automatically.
* **Free or paid**, leave the price at zero for free options such as a personalised message.
* **Cart & order display**, the customer's choices appear in the cart, at checkout, and on the order.
* **Display settings**, choose the group heading, show or hide option prices, toggle the required-field asterisk, and wrap the options in a bordered card, all from the Add-Ons settings page.

Add-on definitions are stored as standard product meta, no custom database tables, so the plugin itself stays small and fast.

Settings live under **WooCommerce → Add-Ons**. Removing the plugin cleans up its own options; your per-product definitions are kept as product meta so re-installing restores them.

The code is developed in the open at https://github.com/wppoland/plogins-addons, that's the place to report a bug or suggest a field type you'd like to see.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to `/wp-content/plugins/plogins-addons`, or install via Plugins → Add New.
2. Activate it. WooCommerce must be active.
3. Edit a product, open the **Add-Ons** tab in the Product data panel, and add your options.

= Does it require WooCommerce? =

Yes. WooCommerce must be installed and active.

= Where do customers see the options? =

On the single product page, just above the Add to cart button. Their selections then show in the cart, at checkout, and on the order.

= What field types are included? =

The free version includes text fields, checkboxes and select drop-downs. Each field can be free or add a price to the cart line.

= Can a product option change the price? =

Yes. Add a price to the row itself or to individual select choices, and Add-Ons adds that amount to the WooCommerce cart line.

= Can I make a product option required? =

Yes. Tick the Required checkbox for an option, and the product cannot be added to the cart until the shopper completes it.

= Can I limit text option length? =

Yes. Text add-ons can have minimum and maximum character limits. The storefront shows a live counter and the server validates the same limits before add to cart.

= Does it create custom database tables? =

No. Add-on definitions are stored as product meta.

= Does it support file uploads or conditional logic? =

Those are PRO features. Add-Ons FREE focuses on fast text, checkbox and select product options.

== External Services ==

Add-Ons does not connect to any external services. It sends no data off your site and loads no remote scripts, fonts or trackers, its admin and storefront CSS/JS are served from the plugin folder on your own server. Your add-on definitions are stored as product meta (`_addons_definitions`) and the display settings in a single option (`addons_settings`), all kept in your WordPress database.

== Changelog ==

= 0.3.1 =
* Renamed to Plogins Add-Ons for WooCommerce for a more distinctive plugin name.
